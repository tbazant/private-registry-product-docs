# Add revision history
When making significant changes to a document, such as adding or deleting features, updating images, fixing broken links or modifying metadata, you must check whether the document's revision history is updated with a brief description and the current date.
If the revision history is not updated, you must update it.
Do not update the revision history for minor fixes, such as typos, grammar corrections or formatting changes.

# Location
- DocBook XML files store the revision history in the main article file
- AsciiDoc files store the revision date in the :revdate: attribute
- AsciiDoc articles usually have a corresponding *-docinfo.xml file with the same <revhistory> structure as a DocBook file

# Markup and formatting
- List revision entries in descending order by date (the newest entry must always come first).
- For AsciiDoc, update the :revdate: attribute to the current date.
- For DocBook, add a new <revision> block inside <revhistory>. Include date in the format `<date>YYYY-MM-DD</date>` and a brief summary of the change inside <revdescription>.
- If making multiple changes of the same type, group them using an <itemizedlist>.

# Example DocBook
Use:

    <revision>
      <date>2026-06-09</date>
      <revdescription><para>Updated chapter on storage, removed obsolete section</para></revdescription>
    </revision>
