This section provides solutions to problems that you may encounter when deploying or using {productname}.

[.qanda]
I am encountering the `401 unauthorized` error when trying to install {productname}::
  To install and use {productname}, you need the following:
  * A qualifying subscription that includes this product, such as a {ranchera} Suite subscription or a {productname} Add-on subscription.
    If you do not have a qualifying subscription, contact your {suse} representative.
  * Log in to {sregistry} with {helm} using the {scca} mirroring credentials of the {scca} organization which holds the subscription.
    Refer to xref:pr-deployment-kube-secrets[] for more details.
